This project is designed for collecting answers and "cheating" on moodle tests. Using the tampermonkey script you collect answers from all users who have installed it, and then others can see the aggregation of answers to questions using the script or a telegram bot. If you want to revitalize a project for your school / institute / moodle site, keep in mind that the code is unstable. Also in the userscript you need to modify the answer parser for a specific moodle site layout (I had a custom display of test percentages, otherwise you don't need to fix the question parser for the general moodle version).

Project frozen. Unstable version.
